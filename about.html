                Hello again. My name is Aatish Dubey. I am a 21 year old aspiring Web Developer in Nepal. I am currently a student of BSc Computing at Naaya Aayam Multi-disciplinary Institute (NAMI) in Jorpati, Kathmandu. Before joining NAMI, I completed my higher secondary
                education from Xavier Academy, Lazimpat. Computer Science was an optional subject in my school, and I had decided to not opt for it. I had always been fascinated by computing devices in general, but I never realised my passion for computing
                until very recently. I joined NAMI with my new-found passion, knowing the college provides a British University degree through joint co-operation with the University of Northampton, UK.</p>
            <p class="paragraph_about"> <!-- Second paragraph for bio -->
                In my very first 12 week term at NAMI, I learned that I had an eye for web design. And I also quickly learned how to turn my designs into functioning websites using just HTML and CSS. I often find myself wondering about ways to create designs that look
                and feel like modern works of art. My fascination with the field has grown tremendously in the past few weeks. I aim to become a skillful web developer one day.
